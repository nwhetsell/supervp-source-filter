# supervp-sourcefilter

This is a Max for Live audio effect that wraps the supervp.sourcefilter\~ object from IRCAM’s [SuperVP for Max](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/supervp-for-max/) v2.18.9. This is in some ways an update of the supervp.sourcefilter\~ wrapper included in https://maxforlive.com/library/device/953/cross-synthesis.

This Max for Live device includes [BrowseRouting.maxpat](BrowseRouting.maxpat) (and the [RoutingObjects.maxpat](RoutingObjects.maxpat) subpatch on which it depends) in a [bpatcher](https://docs.cycling74.com/latest/refpages/bpatcher). BrowseRouting.maxpat is part of Cycling&nbsp;’74’s [Audio Routes](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/5830/audio-routes) suite of Max for Live devices. The “Audio Routing Example.amxd” device from Audio Routes includes this comment about BrowseRouting: “This subpatcher may be freely copied into any device as a bpatcher…”.
